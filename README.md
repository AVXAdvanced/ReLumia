## ‚ö° Flashing

We recommend you use either:

Windows Phone Internals (WPI): https://github.com/ReneLergner/WPinternals
thor2 (Available thru WDRT, Open a Terminal in the WDRT Install Folder)

to flash FFUs onto your phone. For most cases, use WPI, as thor2 is harder to operate.
You'll need thor2 to unbrick your Lumia if it is in this state.

### Flash an FFU File (using WPI)

1) Connect your Lumia to your PC via a USB Cable
   
 ‚ö†Ô∏èCAUTION: VERIFY YOUR CONNECTION IS STABLE AND YOUR LUMIA IS CHARGED BEFORE FLASHING‚ö†Ô∏è

3) Open WPI - If it won't open, unplug your Lumia, open it, and plug your Lumia back in.
4) Click on "Flash" in the sidebar.
5) Scroll down to "Flash original FFU"
6) Select your newly downloaded FFU File
7) Click "Flash FFU image"

Wait for the process to complete. Your Phone will reboot automatically if the Flash has succeeded.

‚ö†Ô∏èDO NOT UNPLUG YOUR DEVICE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! IT WILL GET BRICKED!‚ö†Ô∏è

## üì• Downloads

Since many files are too large to host on GitHub they are uploaded to Internet Archive.
If a Phone's File(s) is/are too big, there will be an Internet Link File in their place.
Download it and double-click it - it will lead you to Internet Archive!

## üß† FAQ
Q: My phone isn't detected by WDRT. Now what?
A: Use the emergency files to revive it into a flashable state.

Q: Can I downgrade to Windows Phone 8.1?
A: If your Phone originally shipped with WP8.1, and it can run it, yes. Simply flash a WP8.1 FFU.

Q: Is this legal?
A: Firmware images are provided for archival and recovery purposes. You're responsible for how you use them.

## ü§ù Contributing
Got a rare FFU? A driver package we missed? PRs are open. Fork, contribute, or just drop a file request in Issues.

## ‚ö∞Ô∏è Why This Exists
Microsoft may have moved on. The forums may have gone dark. But we haven't forgotten these phones.

This project exists to keep Lumia alive ‚Äî whether you're a hacker, collector, archivist, or just trying to fix mom's old 640.
